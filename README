2. Implement the package. (See contents of `setup.py` and `signalform_tools`)
3. Update your integration tests: `$EDITOR yelp_package/itest/ubuntu.sh`
4. Tell Debian how to call your package's executables: `$EDITOR debian/*.links`
5. Run `make test` to run your package's tests with tox.
6. Run `make changelog` to create a Debian changelog (required for tests).
7. Run `make package` to test the package using Docker.

== First Release

When the repository was created, the version number was set to 0.0.1.
Follow these steps to release that as your first versioned package.

1. Your changes should all be merged into `master` already.
2. Run `make package` to test the package using Docker.
5. Run `make tag` to create the v0.0.1 tag in Git.
4. Run `git push origin master && git push origin --tags`.

== Releasing a New Version

When you're ready to release a new version, steps to take are:

1. Update the release number in `signalform_tools/__about__.py`. Follow [http://semver.org/](Semantic Versioning).
2. Run `make changelog` to add a Debian changelog entry.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Run `make package` to test the package using Docker.
